### Makes embeds in the chat area always full width

---

## Installing

1. Install [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/).
2. Download [Wider Embeds](https://github.com/JoshuaDoes/bd-theme-widerembeds/blobs/master/WiderEmbeds.theme.css) and place it in your BetterDiscord themes directory.
3. Open Discord, open the Settings menu, navigate to the Themes tab, and enable "Wider Embeds v1.0 by JoshuaDoes".
4. Profit!

## What does it do?

It simply forces all embeds to be full width. Useful to give more of a single- or multi-line "page" vibe to embeds than just a box wrapping around text, and as a result makes embeds stand out a little more.
